# ACon&#178;: Adpative Conformal Consensus

ACon&#178; is an adpative conformal consensus algorithm for provable blockchain oracles. 
In particular, ACon&#178; returns a set of labels (e.g., a range of a token price)
that likely contains a true label (e.g., a true token price) under distribution shift and adversarial manipulation.
